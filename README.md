## Summary and Recommendations

### Objective
The analysis primarily investigates factors influencing customer churn, particularly focusing on payment methods and contract types.

### Key Insights

1. **Contract Type**:
   - Customers on **month-to-month contracts** show a higher tendency to churn compared to those on yearly or bi-annual contracts.
   - **Implication**: Long-term contracts may improve customer retention.

2. **Payment Methods**:
   - A significant proportion of customers using **electronic checks** are more likely to churn compared to those using other payment methods (credit cards, bank transfers, etc.).
   - **Implication**: This could be due to convenience or trust issues associated with electronic check payments.

3. **Churn Rate by Tenure**:
   - Customers with **shorter tenure (less than one year)** are more likely to churn, indicating the criticality of initial engagement strategies.

4. **Visualizations**:
   - The visualizations, including **bar plots** and **line graphs**, highlight the disparity in churn rates by different contract types and payment methods. 
   - They also show trends over customer tenure, supporting the need for personalized retention strategies.

### Key Insights & Findings

1. **Contract Type and Churn**:
   - **Month-to-Month Contracts**: Highest churn rate at **42%**.
   - **Yearly Contracts**: Churn rate of **11%**.
   - **Two-Year Contracts**: Churn rate of **3%**.
   - **Implication**: Longer contract periods serve as a strong retention tool, as customers with extended commitments are far less likely to leave.

2. **Payment Methods and Churn**:
   - **Electronic Checks**: Highest churn rate at **45%**.
   - **Other Methods**: Credit cards, bank transfers, or mailed checks have significantly lower churn rates, averaging around **15-18%**.
   - **Implication**: The convenience, security, and trust issues related to electronic payments might contribute to churn. Encouraging customers to switch to more stable payment methods could reduce churn.

3. **Churn by Tenure**:
   - **Less than 1 Year**: Churn rate of **50%**.
   - **1â€“3 Years**: Decreasing churn trend at **35%**.
   - **More than 3 Years**: Churn rate of **15%**.
   - **Implication**: Engaging customers early in their journey, especially within the first year, is critical for retention.

4. **Churn by Internet Service Type**:
   - Customers using **Fiber Optic services** show a higher churn rate of **30%**, compared to **DSL customers** with a churn rate of **20%**.
   - **Implication**: This could be due to increased competition or dissatisfaction with service quality. Understanding customer satisfaction with service speed and reliability may help retain fiber optic users.

5. **Senior Citizens and Churn**:
   - **Senior Citizens (65+)**: Churn rate of **41%**.
   - **Non-Senior Citizens**: Churn rate of **26%**.
   - **Implication**: Special retention programs and targeted customer service for senior customers may help reduce churn in this demographic.

## Visualizations & Data Insights

1. **Bar Charts and Line Graphs**:
   - The visual representation of churn by payment method clearly shows that customers using **electronic checks churn almost three times as much** as those using more traditional or secure methods like credit cards.
   - **Customer tenure vs. churn rate visualizations** reveal a clear declining trend in churn as customers' tenure increases, underscoring the need for early-stage customer loyalty programs.

2. **Percentage Distribution of Churn Across Factors**:
   - **Payment Methods**: 45% churn for electronic check users; 15% for credit card users.
   - **Contract Types**: 42% churn for month-to-month contracts; 11% for yearly contracts; 3% for two-year contracts.
   - **Tenure**: 50% churn in the first year, dropping to 15% after three years.

## Recommendations

1. **Promote Long-Term Contracts**:
   - Offer incentives for customers to commit to longer contracts to reduce churn.

2. **Address Payment Method Concerns**:
   - Implement campaigns encouraging customers to switch from electronic checks to more reliable payment methods.

3. **Customer Engagement in Early Tenure**:
   - Focus on improving the customer experience within the first year, as churn is highest in this period.

4. **Special Senior Citizen Retention Programs**:
   - Create personalized offers or assistance programs to retain the senior demographic.
